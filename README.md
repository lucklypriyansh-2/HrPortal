   Steps to run
     1. Download  git project 
     2. import in eclipse as maven
     3  run as maven clean install
     4  run as java application


Solution Approaches

Approach 1
											    Time    Space 	
1 GET LIST OF RELATION FROM UI AND SAVE IN DB  (O(E))    (O(1))
2 CREATE TREE USING HASHMAP IN MEMORY          (O(E))    (O(E))
3 DETECT LOOP IN TREE USING DFS(ITERATIVE)     (O(E))    (O(E))

DISADVANTAGE 
1 HIGH SPACE COMPLEXITY DUE TO IN MEMORY KEEPING UP OF EDGE AND BUILDING TREE
2 PROGRAMME READABILITY WILL BE BAD SINCE WILL USE ITERATIVE APPORACH

ADVANTAGES
1 FAST SINCE ALL COMPUTATION IS HAPPENING IN MEMEORY

APPROACH 2    CHOSEN APPORACH

1 GET LIST OF RELATION FROM UI AND SAVE IN DB     (O(E)) (O(1))
2 USE RECURSIVE APPORACH TO GET LIST OF EDGES   (O(E)) (O(H)) AND DETECT LOOP AT SAME TIME BY CALLING DB 
3 RETURN RESPONSE

ADVANTAGE 
1 SPACE WILL BE RELATIVELY LOW SINCE WE ARE NOT KEEPING  ALL  EDGE IN MEMORY INSTED CALLING DB 
2 WE ARE DETECTING LOOP AND BUILDING TREE AT SAME TIME THIS CAUSE ONLY ONE O(N) OPERATION AND REDUCE COMPUTATION TIME

DISADVANTAGES
1 RECURSION IS SLOW APPROACH TO BUILD THE TREE AND CAN CAUSE STACK OVERFLOW IN CASE DEPTH OF TREE GOES BEYOND A VERY HIGH NUMBER

APPROACH 3    

THE DISDVANTAGE OF ABOVE APPORACH CAN BE REMOVED BY USING ITERATIVE APPORACH OF BUILDING TREE HYBRID OF  APPORACH 1+APPROACH 2

IT WILL HAVE BEST OF BOTH THE APPROACH (SPEED + SPACE)
DISADVANTAGES
1 PROGRAM READABILITY WILL REDUCE A LOT IF CHOSEN APPORACH 3
